                            THE SHORT STORY:<br>
                            I know five instruments. I enjoy playing songs by ear. I have five favorite keys, and I will probably like any song in any language in any style as long as it's in those keys.
                            <br><br>
                            <br><br>

                            THE LONG STORY:<br>
                            I can play Pachelbel's Canon in D with my eyes closed.
                            <br><br>

                            It's a low honor to give to the piece that defined two turning points in my musical career. The prologue first: I listened to my parents' classical music a lot as a kid. I'd heard Pachelbel's Canon and liked it, although I didn't know that was the name at the time. I also knew there were pieces I just liked more than others. The common denominator? Key signature. I could tell them apart, even then, and I already had preferences - with D major being my number one favorite.
                            <br><br>

                            The first turning point: I started piano at six and hated it. Sheet music was the bane of my existence, and there are still tear tracks on my first keyboard. It took three years for me to stumble upon sheet music for Pachelbel's Canon. Squinting at the left hand notes, I made out the first eight notes of the canon and realized I'd heard this before. For once, I didn't despise sheet music. I'd learned scales by then, I recognized it was in the key of D, and I knew that I could play melodies by ear. So I did.
                            <br><br>

                            That was the first piece I played truly for fun. Chords would come to me two years later. When Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield went to space, he played his original piece 'I.S.S' (Is Somebody Singing) in orbit while the Barenaked Ladies accompanied from below. I had the lead sheet on my piano at home to practice - I was only supposed to learn the melody on recorder. But there were chords on the lead sheet too, I noticed. And so what would happen if I played the melody on the right hand while I did chords with the left hand? Well, music, of course.
                            <br><br>
                            <br><br>

                            That was the beginning of my journey into non-classical piano. I started learning new songs by ear and guessing chords to go along. I started learning violin at age 11. The only time I ever used sheet music was when I was playing something more complicated than the pop songs of the early 2010s. I played the Canon at my first violin recital - which was apparently quick progress in six months.
                            <br><br>

                            The second turning point: A friend approached me when I was 13 and asked to play Pachelbel's Canon in D with me on violin for our school's winter concert. We found another violinist and cellist to make a string quartet, and we practiced whenever we could at school. We skipped recesses and went to each other's houses. The day of the concert arrived, and we sat on the stage in a semi-circle, and played.
                            <br><br>

                            It was magical. It was my childhood favorite piece coming to life before me. It was the thrum of the cello and the dancing melodic lines and the harmonies in my favorite key. It was me and my friends drawing those lovely sounds from our instruments. It was our school's best musicians doing what we did best in front of everyone. Something changed for me that day, as the applause continued beyond the curtains. I no longer had stage fright, not when I was playing music that I knew so well. Years of practice and discovering the joy of performance led up to this moment - music had become something that I loved.
                            <br><br>
                            <br><br>

                            In grade 8, I decided that my favorite band was Queen. I dreamed of performing on a stage like they did. To this day, songs like Bohemian Rhapsody are still audience favorites, thanks to Freddie Mercury's charisma. But my favorite Queen member was their quiet bassist, John Deacon. Naturally, I taught myself bass guitar because of that. In grade nine, I told my music teacher that I was going to learn bass. To my relief, she allowed me, with no resistance. I then continued - I didn't actually have a bass at home to practice, can I bring home the school's bass? Yes again. So I lugged the bass in one hand (it didn't have a case) and picked up the amp with the other (with great difficulty) and trudged it to my mom's car.
                            <br><br>

                            I made it into jazz band the following year. By then, I'd taught myself basic guitar and drum skills on top of bass, violin, and piano (the ukulele doesn't really count). I adored band. Playing music with other friends always gave me so much joy. I did jazz band until my last year of high school, after dozens of festivals and concerts. I was a section leader in grade 12 for band, as well as the bassist for our school's jazz combo.
                            <br><br>
                            
                            I also spearheaded two musical arrangements - one of which was Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody. I recruited a rhythm section, a choir, and a lead singer for the song. It had been the most stressful time of my life back then - I was involved in four other musical projects on top of school and getting sick in the late fall. I stayed after school every day for a month to do all sorts of rehearsals. We didn't know that it'd be our last high school concert ever at the time, but we performed Bohemian Rhapsody, and we rocked, because I wanted to make it happen.
                            <br><br>

                            The first quarantine hit after that, as well as the realization that Bohemian Rhapsody was our last hurrah for the class of 2020. And I had to decide between pursuing music or other subjects in post-secondary. I loved music, and I still do, but now I also know that I love my program, and I did make the right decision. But I always wonder if in another universe, I chose music instead. I hope in that universe, I am also happy.
